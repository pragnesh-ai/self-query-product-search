SelfQuery Notebook Repository
## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to preprocess e-commerce data, transform it into a suitable format for vector storage, and perform similarity searches using LangChain, Qdrant, and HuggingFace models. The workflow includes data cleaning, sentence conversion, embedding generation, and vector storage, culminating in querying the stored vectors using a language model.
